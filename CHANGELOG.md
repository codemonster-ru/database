# Changelog

All significant changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.2] - 2025-12-10

### Changed

-   **CLI make:migration:** Migration names must now be CamelCase Latin words (e.g., `CreateUsersTable`); invalid names are rejected with an error.

## [1.4.1] - 2025-12-10

### Added

-   **CLI tests:** Added coverage for skipping already-ran migrations and for migration path resolver uniqueness/default path handling.

### Fixed

-   **Migrator:** Pending detection now compares against ran migration names, preventing repeat execution of logged migrations.
-   **CLI path resolver:** Allows registering default migration path even if the directory does not exist yet and deduplicates entries.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added

-   **ORM test coverage:** Added PHPUnit tests for Model, ModelQuery, ModelCollection, SoftDeletes, and all relation types; seeded fake profiles/roles for relation scenarios.
-   **In-memory fakes:** FakeConnection now exposes table storage; FakeQueryBuilder emulates where/null filters, pivot joins, pagination counters, and CRUD without PDO.

### Fixed

-   Eliminated PHPUnit notice in Migrator tests by stubbing `MigrationPathResolver`.
-   Fake query builder signatures now align with `QueryBuilderInterface` (return types, count/exists) to avoid compatibility errors during tests.

## [1.3.0] – 2025-12-10

### Added

-   **Full ORM layer (ActiveRecord/Eloquent-like):**

    -   `Model`, `ModelQuery`, `ModelCollection`
